# ArcadiaTweaks

Umbrella mod-patch for the **Arcadia** modpack. Server-side, non-invasive, Mixin-based optimizations and tweaks for NeoForge **1.21.1** (build 21.1.221+).

> **First module shipped:** `botany` — server-side hot-path optimizations for [BotanyPots](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots) (Crop/Soil match memoization, hopper-pot export backoff, growth-tick coalescing, etc.).

## Design principles

1. **Mixin only.** No reflection-based patching, no class transformers, no AccessTransformers beyond what NeoForge already provides. The mod is a stack of `@Inject` / `@Redirect` / `@WrapOperation` Mixins.
2. **Non-invasive.** No public API surface change in the targeted mods, no recipe / datapack / registry mutation (KubeJS handles that side of the pack), no client-side rendering changes by default.
3. **Modular.** Each optimization domain lives behind a feature module (`botany`, future modules…). Each module can be disabled at runtime via the config file.
4. **Per-strategy kill-switch.** Inside a module, **every** Mixin path has a dedicated TOML toggle. Anything can be turned off without rebuilding.
5. **Addon-friendly.** Mixins use default priority (1000) and target stable internal classes; we never patch SPI / API surfaces consumed by addons (e.g. BotanyTrees).

## Project layout

Single Gradle project. Source code is split at the **package** level into `common/` (loader-agnostic logic) and `neoforge/` (entry point + Mixins). This keeps the door open for an Architectury split later if Fabric becomes a target, without paying the build complexity now.

```

### Adding a new module

1. Create `common/modules/<id>/<Id>Module.java` implementing `ArcadiaModule`.
2. Create `common/modules/<id>/<Id>Config.java` carrying the ModConfigSpec entries (build them in the constructor, push/pop a `[<id>]` section).
3. Wire it into `ArcadiaConfig` (instantiate the config + add a `MODULE_<ID>_ENABLED` toggle under `[modules]`).
4. Register the module in `ModuleRegistry.bootstrap()`.
5. Drop your Mixin classes under `neoforge/mixin/<id>/` and list them in `arcadiatweaks.mixins.json`.

## Build

Requires **JDK 21** and the Gradle wrapper.

```bash
# first time only - generate the wrapper jar
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10

# build
./gradlew build

# the jar lands in build/libs/arcadiatweaks-<version>.jar
```

### Dev runtime mods (`libs/`)

ArcadiaTweaks targets BotanyPots via Mixin, so dev runs need the **exact** jars from production on the classpath. We do not consume them from a public maven; we drop the jars from the production instance directly into `libs/`.

Source path on the maintainer's machine:

```
C:\Users\curveo\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\Arcadia Echoes Of Power V2\mods
```

Required jars (and the version each must match in `gradle.properties`):

| File in `libs/`                                | gradle.properties key  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `botanypots-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`         | `botanypots_version`   |
| `bookshelf-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`          | `bookshelf_version`    |
| `prickle-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`            | `prickle_version`      |

`libs/*.jar` is gitignored - each developer copies their own from the production pack. When the pack updates BotanyPots/Bookshelf/Prickle, refresh `libs/` and bump the corresponding `gradle.properties` values to match the new filenames.

### Run a dev client / server

```bash
./gradlew runClient
./gradlew runServer
```

### Run automated tests (NeoForge GameTest)

```bash
./gradlew runGameTestServer
```

This boots a headless 1.21.1 server with BotanyPots, Bookshelf and Prickle on the classpath, runs every `@GameTest` registered under the `arcadiatweaks` namespace, and exits non-zero on the first failure.

Current suite (all green):

| Test                              | What it asserts                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `smoke`                           | The structure loads and the gametest pipeline is wired                                                           |
| `s1ConsistentSoilLookup`          | Two consecutive `getOrInvalidateSoil` calls return the same `Soil` instance (S1 cache is coherent)               |
| `s1CropGrowthAdvances`            | Pot + dirt + wheat seeds → after 150 ticks `growthTime > 0` (S1 does not break growth)                           |
| `s1CacheInvalidatesOnSeedSwap`    | Swapping seed item invalidates the cached crop recipe (S1 invalidation triggers on slot change)                  |
| `s1MicrobenchProvesGain`          | Tight-loop ratio of `getOrInvalidate` with S1 off vs on - **fails if the gain is below 30%**, logs ns/op + speedup |

Last recorded microbench (200 000 iterations, Ryzen 9 7900X, JDK 21.0.10):

```
off = 259.1 ns/op    on = 146.7 ns/op    speedup = 1.77x    gain = 43.4%
```

This is a tight-loop measurement of the exact code S1 caches (`matches()` invocation through `getOrInvalidate`), **not** full `tickPot` cost. It is the upper bound of S1's contribution on the production hot path - a real Spark profile on a dense farm will show a lower percentage because `tickPot` includes work outside S1's scope (cooldowns, hopper export, `getRequiredGrowthTicks`, `crop.onTick`).

Tests live in `src/main/java/com/teamarcadia/arcadiatweaks/neoforge/gametest/BotanyPotsGameTests.java`.

The structure they spawn into is a 3×3×3 stone-floor platform shipped as binary NBT at `src/main/resources/data/arcadiatweaks/structure/empty_platform.nbt` (singular folder, `.nbt` — vanilla MC 1.21 `StructureTemplateManager` does not load `.snbt` from datapacks). The `.nbt` is regenerated by `python scripts/gen_empty_platform_nbt.py` if you ever need to tweak the platform.

In a normal `runClient`/`runServer` you can also drive tests interactively from chat:

```text
/test runall                       # run every registered test in a fresh batch
/test runthis                      # run the test of the structure you're standing on
/test exportall                    # snapshot every loaded test into the world save
/test create <name> <x> <y> <z>    # create a new test arena, then build inside it
```

The dev runs are pre-configured with `mixin.debug=true` and `mixin.debug.export=true`, so the bytecode of every Mixin-applied class is dumped to `run/.mixin.out/class/` for inspection.

## Install (production)

Drop the jar into your server `mods/` folder. ArcadiaTweaks declares **BotanyPots as `optional`** — if BotanyPots is absent the `botany` Mixins simply do not match anything and stay dormant.

The config file is generated on first run at:

```
<server>/config/arcadiatweaks-common.toml
```

Edit it, restart the server, done.

## Validate the Mixin pipeline

On server start, look for this line in the log:

```
[ArcadiaTweaks/INFO]: [Mixin] Pipeline OK - HelloWorldMixin attached to MinecraftServer.runServer.
```

If you see it, the Mixin transform is working and you can ship real optimizations on top.

## Benchmark protocol (Spark)

Reference: [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/botanypots-server-optimization-research-2026-04-25.md`](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/botanypots-server-optimization-research-2026-04-25.md), section 5.

### Required mods on the bench server

- [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) — sampler + tick monitor
- BotanyPots + the addons present in production (BotanyTrees, etc.)
- ArcadiaTweaks (the build to evaluate)

### Reproducible test world

- 30 chunks `entity-ticking` around spawn, force-loaded (`/forceload add ...`)
- 400 pots: 200 `BASIC` + 200 `HOPPER`
- Crop mix: 50% simple crop (wheat), 50% crop with `pot_predicate` (worst case for the matches() hot path)
- Hopper inventories: 100 pots over an empty chest, 100 pots over a **full** chest (worst case for S3)
- 1 fake player (`/player`) to keep the chunks loaded

### Measurement

```text
# Baseline (ArcadiaTweaks botany module disabled or jar absent):
warm up 2 minutes, then:
/spark profiler --timeout 180 --thread "Server thread"
/spark tickmonitor 60

# Run with module enabled, repeat the same commands.
# Compare flame graphs in the Spark web viewer.
```

Targets: **−80% cumulative time on `BotanyPotBlockEntity#tickPot`**, MSPT cut by at least 30% on the dense farm scenario. See research doc §5.3 / §5.5 for per-strategy go/no-go thresholds.

### Going live without surprises

Ramp the kill-switches one at a time:

1. Boot with everything **off** in `[botany]` — confirm the module loads cleanly and the hello-world Mixin still logs.
2. Enable `s1_matches_cache_enabled` only. Bench, validate.
3. Enable `s3_hopper_backoff_enabled`. Bench, validate.
4. Enable `s2_tick_coalescing_enabled` with `tick_coalescing_n=2`, then `=4`. Bench at each step.
5. Enable `a1_required_growth_ticks_cache_enabled`, `a2_light_flag_downgrade_enabled` if the profile still shows headroom.

Keep `safety_revalidate_period_ticks = 200` while ramping — it bounds any cache-staleness bug to ~10 seconds of weirdness max.
