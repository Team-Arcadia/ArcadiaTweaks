# ArcadiaTweaks

Umbrella mod-patch for the **Arcadia** modpack. Mostly server-side, non-invasive, Mixin-based optimizations and tweaks for NeoForge **1.21.1** (build 21.1.221+). The Mekanism module also contains one optional client-side rendering safety patch.

> **First module shipped:** `botany` — server-side hot-path optimizations for [BotanyPots](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots) (Crop/Soil match memoization, hopper-pot export backoff, growth-tick coalescing, etc.).

## Design principles

1. **Mixin only.** No reflection-based patching, no class transformers, no AccessTransformers beyond what NeoForge already provides. The mod is a stack of `@Inject` / `@Redirect` / `@WrapOperation` Mixins.
2. **Non-invasive.** No public API surface change in the targeted mods, no recipe / datapack / registry mutation (KubeJS handles that side of the pack), and client-side rendering changes are limited to explicit Mekanism safety toggles.
3. **Modular.** Each optimization domain lives behind a feature module (`botany`, future modules…). Each module can be disabled at runtime via the config file.
4. **Per-strategy kill-switch.** Inside a module, **every** Mixin path has a dedicated TOML toggle. Anything can be turned off without rebuilding.
5. **Addon-friendly.** Mixins use default priority (1000) and target stable internal classes; we never patch SPI / API surfaces consumed by addons (e.g. BotanyTrees).

## Project layout

Single Gradle project. Source code is split at the **package** level into `common/` (loader-agnostic logic) and `neoforge/` (entry point + Mixins). This keeps the door open for an Architectury split later if Fabric becomes a target, without paying the build complexity now.

```

### Adding a new module

1. Create `common/modules/<id>/<Id>Module.java` implementing `ArcadiaModule`.
2. Create `common/modules/<id>/<Id>Config.java` carrying the ModConfigSpec entries (build them in the constructor, push/pop a `[<id>]` section).
3. Wire it into `ArcadiaConfig` (instantiate the config + add a `MODULE_<ID>_ENABLED` toggle under `[modules]`).
4. Register the module in `ModuleRegistry.bootstrap()`.
5. Drop your Mixin classes under `neoforge/mixin/<id>/` and list them in `arcadiatweaks.mixins.json`.

## Build

Requires **JDK 21** and the Gradle wrapper.

```bash
# first time only - generate the wrapper jar
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10

# build
./gradlew build

# the jar lands in build/libs/arcadiatweaks-<version>.jar
```

Patch-specific jars can be built from the same compiled classes. The default
`build` jar keeps every patch enabled; the variant jars filter the Mixin configs
and optional dependencies declared in `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`.

```bash
# one jar with every patch
./gradlew jarAllPatches

# one jar with only the BotanyPots patch loaded
./gradlew jarBotanyPatch

# one jar with only the Refined Storage patch loaded
./gradlew jarRefinedStoragePatch

# one jar with only the Mekanism patch loaded
./gradlew jarMekanismPatch

# property-based selection
./gradlew jarSelectedPatch -ParcadiaPatch=botany
./gradlew jarSelectedPatch -ParcadiaPatch=refinedstorage
./gradlew jarSelectedPatch -ParcadiaPatch=mekanism
./gradlew jarSelectedPatch -ParcadiaPatch=all

# build all variants at once
./gradlew jarPatchVariants
```

The in-game admin command follows the jar variant:

| Jar variant | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| all patches | `/arcadiatweaks gui` |
| BotanyPots only | `/botanypatch gui` |
| Refined Storage only | `/refinedstoragepatch gui` |
| Mekanism only | `/mekanismpatch gui` |

`admin` remains available as an alias for `gui`.

Patch compatibility is guarded by structure, not by version string. If a newer
target mod still exposes the same classes, fields and method descriptors, the
patch applies. If a target moved or changed signature, only the affected Mixin is
skipped and ArcadiaTweaks writes one short warning instead of hard-crashing on a
missing injection target. In the all-patches jar, a skipped BotanyPots Mixin does
not disable Refined Storage or Mekanism Mixins, and vice versa.

### Dev runtime mods (`libs/`)

ArcadiaTweaks targets other mods via Mixin, so dev runs need the **exact** jars from production on the classpath. We do not consume them from a public maven; we drop the jars from the production instance directly into `libs/`.

Source path on the maintainer's machine:

```
C:\Users\curveo\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\Arcadia Echoes Of Power V2\mods
```

Required jars (and the version each must match in `gradle.properties`):

| File in `libs/`                                | gradle.properties key  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `botanypots-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`         | `botanypots_version`   |
| `bookshelf-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`          | `bookshelf_version`    |
| `prickle-neoforge-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`            | `prickle_version`      |
| `refinedstorage-neoforge-<ver>.jar`            | `refinedstorage_version` |
| `Mekanism-1.21.1-<ver>.jar`                    | `mekanism_version`     |

`libs/*.jar` is gitignored - each developer copies their own from the production pack. When the pack updates a targeted mod, refresh `libs/` and bump the corresponding `gradle.properties` values to match the new filenames.

### Run a dev client / server

```bash
./gradlew runClient
./gradlew runServer
```

### Run automated tests

The `test` branch carries a NeoForge GameTest scaffolding (work in progress). On `main`, no automated tests yet.

The dev runs are pre-configured with `mixin.debug=true` and `mixin.debug.export=true`, so the bytecode of every Mixin-applied class is dumped to `run/.mixin.out/class/` for inspection.

## Install (production)

Drop the jar into your server `mods/` folder. For the Mekanism M4 rendering safety patch, also ship the same jar on clients through the Arcadia launcher. ArcadiaTweaks declares **BotanyPots as `optional`** — if BotanyPots is absent the `botany` Mixins simply do not match anything and stay dormant.

The config file is generated on first run at:

```
<server or client>/config/arcadiatweaks-common.toml
```

Edit it, restart the server or client, done. Server GUI changes affect the server config only; client rendering settings must be present on each client.

## Recommended Settings

These are the recommended production settings for Arcadia. They prioritize low
regression risk while still cutting repeated tick work. Every setting is also
available in the in-game admin GUI, except client-only rendering settings that
must be configured on each client.

### Module toggles

| Setting | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `modules.botany` | `true` | Enable BotanyPots patch when BotanyPots is present. |
| `modules.refinedstorage` | `true` | Enable Refined Storage patch when RS2 is present. |
| `modules.mekanism` | `true` | Enable Mekanism cable/network patch when Mekanism is present. |

### BotanyPots

Best balanced profile:

```toml
[botany]
matches_cache_enabled = true
tick_coalescing_enabled = true
tick_coalescing_n = 4
hopper_backoff_enabled = true
hopper_backoff_min_ticks = 16
hopper_backoff_max_ticks = 64
required_growth_ticks_cache_enabled = true
light_flag_downgrade_enabled = false
safety_revalidate_period_ticks = 200
```

| Setting | Best value | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `matches_cache_enabled` | `true` | Biggest safe win; caches crop/soil recipe match checks between slot/state changes. |
| `tick_coalescing_enabled` | `true` | Runs full pot logic once every `tick_coalescing_n` ticks, with accumulator compensation. |
| `tick_coalescing_n` | `4` | Best balance for dense farms. Use `2` if players notice harvest/comparator latency, `1` to disable. |
| `hopper_backoff_enabled` | `true` | Skips repeated failed exports when the inventory below is full or unavailable. |
| `hopper_backoff_min_ticks` | `16` | Good first failure delay without making export recovery feel stale. |
| `hopper_backoff_max_ticks` | `64` | Caps exponential backoff at ~3.2 seconds. Increase only for farms constantly pushing into full inventories. |
| `required_growth_ticks_cache_enabled` | `true` | Caches required growth tick calculation until slot/tool changes. |
| `light_flag_downgrade_enabled` | `false` | Keep off by default. Enable only if Spark shows neighbor/light update cost from Botany inventory updates. |
| `safety_revalidate_period_ticks` | `200` | Revalidates cached invariants every ~10 seconds. Keep this on in production. |

Aggressive Botany profile for static farms:

```toml
tick_coalescing_n = 8
hopper_backoff_max_ticks = 200
```

Use this only when farms are mostly unattended and comparator/export latency is
acceptable.

### Refined Storage

Best balanced profile:

```toml
[refinedstorage]
activeness_check_coalescing_enabled = true
activeness_check_interval_ticks = 20
```

| Setting | Best value | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `activeness_check_coalescing_enabled` | `true` | Coalesces node/transmitter activeness state checks while keeping importer/exporter work cadence intact. |
| `activeness_check_interval_ticks` | `20` | Best conservative value. Worst-case redstone/energy active-state visual delay is 19 ticks. |

Use `10` if you want quicker redstone/energy activeness response. Use `1` to
disable coalescing without disabling the whole module.

### Mekanism

Best balanced profile:

```toml
[mekanism]
transmitter_pull_backoff_enabled = true
transmitter_pull_backoff_max_ticks = 20
network_emit_backoff_enabled = true
network_emit_backoff_max_ticks = 20
logistical_transporter_idle_backoff_enabled = true
logistical_transporter_idle_backoff_max_ticks = 20
client_logistical_transporter_safe_rendering_enabled = true
client_transmitter_model_cache_max_entries = 4096
```

| Setting | Best value | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `transmitter_pull_backoff_enabled` | `true` | Backs off Universal Cable, Mechanical Pipe and Pressurized Tube pull scans when they repeatedly pull nothing. |
| `transmitter_pull_backoff_max_ticks` | `20` | Caps pull retry delay at 1 second after repeated no-op pulls. |
| `network_emit_backoff_enabled` | `true` | Backs off energy/fluid/chemical network emit scans when the network repeatedly emits nothing. |
| `network_emit_backoff_max_ticks` | `20` | Caps emit retry delay at 1 second. Heat networks are not touched. |
| `logistical_transporter_idle_backoff_enabled` | `true` | Backs off repeated no-target idle path recalculations for Logistical Transporters. This targets `TransporterStack.calculateIdle` / `TransporterPathfinder.getIdlePath`. |
| `logistical_transporter_idle_backoff_max_ticks` | `20` | Caps idle-path retry delay at 1 second. Destination and home paths are not throttled. |
| `client_logistical_transporter_safe_rendering_enabled` | `true` | Client-side only. Keeps colored Logistical Transporters visible, but avoids Mekanism's translucent colored layer path suspected of causing progressive FPS/memory degradation. Item routing colors remain server-side. |
| `client_transmitter_model_cache_max_entries` | `4096` | Client-side only. Clears Mekanism's transmitter baked-model cache if it grows abnormally high. Defensive leak guard; normal scenes should stay below this. |

Aggressive Mekanism profile for very large idle cable networks:

```toml
transmitter_pull_backoff_max_ticks = 40
network_emit_backoff_max_ticks = 40
logistical_transporter_idle_backoff_max_ticks = 40
```

Use this only if Spark still shows Mekanism cable/network scans high after the
balanced profile. It can add up to ~2 seconds before an idle, repeatedly failing
connection retries or idle transporter path recalculations.

## Validate the Mixin pipeline

On server start, look for this line in the log:

```
[ArcadiaTweaks/INFO]: [Mixin] Pipeline OK - HelloWorldMixin attached to MinecraftServer.runServer.
```

If you see it, the Mixin transform is working and you can ship real optimizations on top.

## Benchmark protocol (Spark)

Reference: [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/botanypots-server-optimization-research-2026-04-25.md`](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/botanypots-server-optimization-research-2026-04-25.md), section 5.

### Required mods on the bench server

- [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) — sampler + tick monitor
- BotanyPots + the addons present in production (BotanyTrees, etc.)
- ArcadiaTweaks (the build to evaluate)

### Reproducible test world

- 30 chunks `entity-ticking` around spawn, force-loaded (`/forceload add ...`)
- 400 pots: 200 `BASIC` + 200 `HOPPER`
- Crop mix: 50% simple crop (wheat), 50% crop with `pot_predicate` (worst case for the matches() hot path)
- Hopper inventories: 100 pots over an empty chest, 100 pots over a **full** chest (worst case for S3)
- 1 fake player (`/player`) to keep the chunks loaded

### Measurement

```text
# Baseline (ArcadiaTweaks botany module disabled or jar absent):
warm up 2 minutes, then:
/spark profiler --timeout 180 --thread "Server thread"
/spark tickmonitor 60

# Run with module enabled, repeat the same commands.
# Compare flame graphs in the Spark web viewer.
```

Targets: **−80% cumulative time on `BotanyPotBlockEntity#tickPot`**, MSPT cut by at least 30% on the dense farm scenario. See research doc §5.3 / §5.5 for per-strategy go/no-go thresholds.

### Going live without surprises

Ramp the kill-switches one at a time:

1. Boot with everything **off** in `[botany]` — confirm the module loads cleanly and the hello-world Mixin still logs.
2. Enable `s1_matches_cache_enabled` only. Bench, validate.
3. Enable `s3_hopper_backoff_enabled`. Bench, validate.
4. Enable `s2_tick_coalescing_enabled` with `tick_coalescing_n=2`, then `=4`. Bench at each step.
5. Enable `a1_required_growth_ticks_cache_enabled`, `a2_light_flag_downgrade_enabled` if the profile still shows headroom.

Keep `safety_revalidate_period_ticks = 200` while ramping — it bounds any cache-staleness bug to ~10 seconds of weirdness max.
